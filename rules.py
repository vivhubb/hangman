================================= GAME RULES =================================

 The computer thinks of a random word or phrase, based on the difficulty level
 you choose (easy(E) for guessing words and hard(H) for guessing phrases) and
 displays a row of underlines representing each letter in every word or phrase.
 You will guess letters, one at a time and your goal is to guess the correct
 answer before the man is hung.

 Each time a correct letter is guessed, the computer fills in all the
 corresponding empty places. If the guess is wrong, the computer will
 draw a body part of the stick man. (All special characters will be given,
 you'll only have to guess letters.)

 The stick man consists of 11 body parts, meaning you can make 11 mistakes
 before the stick man is completed. If the man is hung before the word is
 guessed: YOU LOSE; if you guess the word before that: YOU WIN.
