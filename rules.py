================================= GAME RULES =================================

Your goal is to guess the word before the man is hung.
The computer thinks of a word, (phrase or sentence), and draws a row of dashes
representing each letter of the word. You will guess letters, one at a time,
until you guess the word or the man gets hung and you die.

Each time a correct letter is guessed from the word, the computer fills in all
the corresponding empty dashes with that letter for the word. If the
letter doesnâ€™t belong to the word, the computer will draw another
body part of stick man.

The stick man consists of 11 body parts, meaning you have 11 lives. If the
stick man is completed before the word is guessed, then YOU LOSE. If the word
is filled in before the stick man is completed then YOU WIN.
